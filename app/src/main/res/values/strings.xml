        <item>In the year 1999, Farhan Qureshi and Raju Rastogi begin their college year in the prestigious Imperial College of Engineering (ICE) in Delhi. They are joined by Ranchoddas Chanchad, nicknamed Rancho, as their roommate. They meet Manmohan a.k.a. Millimetre, an adolescent boy helping the students . He is persuaded by Rancho to sneak into school and get educated. While Farhan chose to pursue engineering over his passion for photography to appease his father, Raju has taken the course in an attempt to end his family poverty and is always afraid of failing.
